### Executive Summary
The most common air travel scams are the ones that occur in an online space. It is easy for scammers to build a fake airline website with very similar text and images to persuade users and take away their money.

Airscammer is a web application that simulates what a potentially suspicious booking website will typically do, the name Airscammer is inspired by "Skyscanner" an actual aggregator airline website. The purpose of this project is to educate my user to pay attention to online booking by setting up some "traps" for them and informing them what potential harm could come from those "traps". 

This web application is developed with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MYSQL, Node.JS, Passport and JavaScript. This is a self-sponsored, individual project developed in a span of 3 weeks with iterations each week. During the 3 weeks period I was able to push myself and add some additional features such as showing local time when user is logged in and deploying the application to a cloud server.

With Airscammer I aim to make learning more fun, instead of reading a bunch of articles and not fully understanding them, we can just learn by doing!

### SDLC
The agile methodology is very effective for this project, Agile lets me develop projects in small increments and lets me focus on the MVP first before going through with other parts of the application. Features and functionality can be added or modified with relative ease, the 1-week sprints are very effective for me as it motivates me to finish quickly and reach the next goal. I'm able to complete the project earlier than expected and additional features to my web application.

### User Guide
Booking:
1.	Go to the homepage, pick the date and destination, and click search flight.
2.	Users will be taken to choose flights. 
3.	After the user chooses the flight, they will be taken to fill in their detail (customer details will ask for suspicious questions and the user will be made obvious to educate them on this topic).
4.	Click “Register”.
5.	The user will be taken to the login page to see the statistics data. 
6.	Login to see the statistics data. 
7.	In case you forgotten your password please go to the contact page and let me know.

Contact page:
1.	Fill in the details and message
2.	Click “send”
3.	Message will be sent to my email address.

### Future Software Enhancement List
The next version of Airscammer will have a "forgot password" feature so users can automatically reset their password instead of emailing the admin to change their password. 

### Reflection
I started with a little knowledge of HTML, CSS, and some experience in building static websites in WordPress and Wix. 
By doing this project I learned how to expand my basic knowledge of HTML & CSS into a fully working web application. I expanded my knowledge of SDLC, server-side and client-side web applications and learned how to use Bootstrap, MYSQL, Node.JS, Passport, user authentication and JavaScript. I am very happy to be able to learn about creating a web application with a database and deploying it online, it is the next step in my learning journey to fully expand that knowledge and build more applications with back-end. 

I am aware that there is much more to learn, and I am very motivated to learn more about APIs, React, and other frameworks in the future. 
With the agile methodology I learned from this course, I improved my project and time management skills. I was able to do more than the required which is fully deploying the web application to a cloud server. The learning environment was good and collaborative with people helping each other.  

If I am to do this project or a similar project again, I will try to do the web app with a mobile-first approach and try to flesh out all the requirements more in-depth before starting to add more dependencies to my project.
